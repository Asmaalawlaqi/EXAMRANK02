### write the code step by step:
* Write a program that takes a string and displays this string after rotating it one word to the left.
* the first word becomes the last, and others stay in the same order.
* A "word" is defined as a part of a string delimited either by spaces/tabs, or by the start/end of the string.
* Words will be separated by only one space in the output.
* If there's less than one argument, the program displays \n.

1. Write a program that takes a string: int	main(int argc, char **argv)
2. c
3. f
4. f
5. f
6. If there's less than one argument, the program displays \n.
```
	if (argc >= 2)
	{
	}
  	write(1, "\n", 1);
}
```
